the rar file has all the gbr files in it, just if you dont trust a stranger on the internet to not hack you, the option in there.

the board layout is the non-stacked schamatic as shown under the "Smol Tracker" section in the SlimeVR Docs, so when uploading the pre compiled firmware onto the tracker use the non-stacked one.

For context, a couple weeks ago i watched a video on youtube by Adament IT on his smol slime trackers.
Me and a few others commented under his video asking if we could get the files to the custom PCBs he used in the video, he has not yet gotten back me or uploaded the files on his getub.
So i took this as an oprotunity to try and disign my own PCBs, and these would be them.

note: these are the first time i have ever disigned PCBs, this is a warning that the disign its definetly inefficient, and in all likelyhood, hot garbage. Use with discretion.
